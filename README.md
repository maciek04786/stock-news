# stock-news
This app checks TESLA stock prices through Alpha Vantage stock API, compares it to the previous day and if the
difference is 5% of more, it sends an email with three latest news regarding the company from www.newsapi.org, 
which might help with working out the reason for the price change and make a decision on what to do next.
This one I am quite proud of, it was an assignment from my Python course, I was feeling fairly confident with using API's
by that point, so I've decided to go for the extra-hard option with no hints, only three steps on how to complete the task.
